# Energy-Consumption-Forecasting-using-Time-Series-Models-
This project focuses on forecasting energy consumption using advanced time series modeling techniques. By leveraging historical energy usage data, I implemented and compared multiple forecasting models — SARIMA, LSTM, and Facebook Prophet — to predict future consumption trends.
